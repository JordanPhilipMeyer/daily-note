# Daily Note

Simple python script that generates a daily note with PreOp, Op, and PostOp logging. PreOp intends to capture synthesis from the day prior, op sets out the plan for the day, and postop is the summary and ideas that I need to carry over for the next day.

## ## To do

- [ ] create a map of content that ties together a full month of notes
- [ ] obsidian link to prior day's notes
